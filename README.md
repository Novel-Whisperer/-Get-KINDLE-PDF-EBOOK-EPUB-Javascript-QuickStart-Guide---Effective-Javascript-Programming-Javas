Title: .0 out of 5 stars This book helped get me back up to speed with JS
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 10, 2016
Review: I wanted to brush up on my JavaScript skills because I am preparing for a contract/remote job position, so I thought it best to make sure that my current skills reflect my resume. I picked up this JavaScript book because I thought that it would help me get back to the point where I once was, and it most certainly did! The book is well-written, easy to understand and very thorough at training on everything I once knew but forgot, and within a matter of about an hour or so of going through the manual and practicing the included exercises, I was well on my way to sharpening my skills. I am currently far more confident in my abilities, and believe that should I be asked anything about my qualifications, I'll be able to pass with flying colors.

Review: A lot of great advice is packed in this short and sweet excellent book, as it concisely illustrates a number of details that would be impossible to find in other books - each page holds valuable lesson, instructions and examples. In truth, I was afraid of the language and it appeared to be a very inconsistent, buggy system that took arcane knowledge to master across browsers. Highly recommended if you have previously thought negative things about JavaScript and want to improve you JavaScript skills.

Review: I got this book out of curiousness as I've heard a lot about Java Script in our office. Upon having read this I found that Java Script is a programming language that is essential in the structuring of a web page. Since I am very interested in this, I will certainly try this out and use this book as my reference. I will surely find myself a positive outcome in the near future. Nice one!

Review: This is the perfect companion for anyone wanting to learn JavaScript and at this price, it is a true bargain. It is well organized and a great start for someone wanting to learn the logic and basics behind Javascript. There are plenty of examples and labs included within this book to get you up and running fast.
A good starting point for beginners and a handy reference tool for those who already are familiar.

Review: Very resourceful book. I learned a lot from the history of javascript the creator, how it was done in 10 days. To the different types of advantages, you would have using javascript. It even lists the limitations one will have when using javascript. How it has changed today. This book also lists a lot of its uses and concepts on javascript. I bought this book in hopes to learn more on javascript as I am very new to this. I am also enrolled in a computer networking class so I am very interested. Well written book,‚Äã and very detailed. I definitely recommend this book to anyone new to this subject

Review: Javascript (or any progamming language) can be a very intimidating thing to learn, especially when you're first starting.
This book is perfect for beginners, since it is very well written, and it breaks javascript down into very easy to understand sections that will make it possible for anyone to learn the language.
I liked the fact that the book is filled with examples, so that you can better understand the concepts explained.
It also talks about Javascript's history and its evolution over the years.
Great book.
